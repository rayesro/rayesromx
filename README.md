- 👋 Hi, I’m @rayesromx and I'm located on Monterrey, Mexico.
- 👀 I’m interested in all Dotnet related stuff, I'm very much into C# but also on C++ mixed with computer graphics and game dev mainly because I started my dev journey playing with C++ and this topics. Also because I'm a part-time C++ professor at my _alma mater_ which is something I really enjoy to do. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OpenGL, I mean "relearing", I'm getting back to my roots and it's been a while since I used OpenGL.
- 📫 How to reach me? Send me an email to ray.esro@gmail.com or a message on my Linkedin account> https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayespinosar/
- 💞️ Fun (and loving fact): I was very much into C++ and OpenGL at college, my skills on that were not so good but above of the averge. One day I met a girl, other day I made a failing openGL animation and I did ask her to be my gf, a couple of days later we are building and developing our lifes together.
